NOTES

kernel dies instantly when dgl starts using the GPU with CUDA 11.6

Use `!nvidia-smi` to check CUDA version and GPU information. 

TODO
- port architecture code from dgl to pytorch_geometric
- there is not that much, there is a lot of boilerplate that was used for the `ogb-code2` task
	- this is about predicting tokens in python ASTs?
	- I don't remember this in the paper
