# Contrastive Learning for Graph2Seq

Contrastive learning regularizers for Graph2Seq models using Multi-Level Attention Pooling (MLAP) encoders. The regularizers are based on work done in [Graph Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Augmentation (GCA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14945.pdf) and [Deep Graph Infomax (DGI)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10341.pdf).
